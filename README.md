# K-Means-Clustering-for-Unlabeled-Disease-Survival-Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of K-Means Clustering on a mostly unlabelled dataset. This unsupervised learning method can lead to clusters that may indicate survival or death when infected with certain respiratory diseases (COVID19, SARS, ARDS, Streptococcus).
